# sample Amanda2 disklist file, derived from CS.UMD.EDU's disklist
#
# If your configuration is called, say, "csd2", then this file normally goes
# in /etc/amanda/csd2/disklist.
#
# File format is:
#
#	hostname diskdev dumptype
#
# where the dumptypes are defined by you in amanda.conf.


# At our site, root partitions have a different dumptype because they
# are of lower priority; they don't contain user data, and don't change
# much from the department prototype.  In a crunch, they can be left for
# last or skipped.

## We don't run compression on the master host since it is going to be
## busy enough running amanda.
#master sd0a nocomp-root -1 local
#master sd0g nocomp-user -1 local
## note: -1 is a placeholder for the spindle number
## the holding disk can't be dumped to itself, it uses a disktype that
## specifies the "no-hold" option (see amanda.conf).
#master sd1c holding-disk -1 local
#
## The chairman's disk is high priority to make sure it gets done.

## Likewise the named databases in the root partition on our primary
## nameserver.  Also, compression is turned off because we don't want
## to create any unnecessary load on this baby (it's only a Sun3).

## Some really slow machines, like Sun2's and some Vaxstations, take
## forever to compress their dumps: it's just not worth it.
